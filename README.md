# User-Authorization-flask
A user authorization page in flask using MySql database
This is a user authorization page in flask using MySql databse. I have used third party app called XAMPP Control and then used phpmyadmin for MySql database connection.
The app provides basic functionalities such as register, login , logout etc.
Install all required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt command. Then simply register using a email id , name and password. If your email-id is taken , page will show it.
